What makes a clean code?

Based on the Clean Code book, we can describe certain rules: 
Good variable and method names 
Good use of the camel case according to the language we are using 
Respect the SOLID principles of classes and methods, where each piece of code does not adopt or perform more responsibilities than it should 
Don't hardcode strings or values 
Respect tabulation of the project if it is appropriate to the technology 
Respect the architecture being used
